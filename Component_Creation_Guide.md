# Component Creation Guide - ReRightGame

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for creating and configuring game objects in the ReRightGame Unity project. Follow these specifications to ensure proper integration with the game's systems.

## Unity Layers and Tags Configuration

### Layers
Configure these layers in Unity's Layer settings:
- **Player**: For the player character
- **InteractableLayer**: For NPCs and interactive objects
- **SolidObjects**: For walls, obstacles, and collision objects

### Tags
Configure these tags in Unity's Tag Manager:
- **Player**: Player character identification
- **NPC**: Standard scripted NPCs
- **NPC_AI**: AI-powered NPCs with LLM integration
- **Player_Interaction_Point**: Player's interaction detection point
- **Interactable**: General interactable objects
- **GameController**: Main game controller object

- Interaction zones require proper tag configuration
- Movement validation depends on correct layer assignment

### AI Integration
- NPCs with `NPC_AI` tag automatically establish server connections
- LLM_NPCController manages conversation context and personality
- Network communication requires proper server setup

### Dialog Integration
- All interactive objects must implement `Interactable_intf`
- Dialog system coordinates with game state management
- Both scripted and AI conversations use the same interface

### Performance Considerations
- Shared components reduce memory overhead
- Singleton patterns provide efficient global access
- Event-driven architecture minimizes coupling

## Common Setup Issues

### Missing Components
- Ensure all required scripts are attached
- Verify proper tag and layer assignment
- Check script execution order dependencies

### Physics Problems
