# Component Creation Guide - ReRightGame

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for creating and configuring game objects in the ReRightGame Unity project. Follow these specifications to ensure proper integration with the game's systems.

## Unity Layers and Tags Configuration

### Layers
Configure these layers in Unity's Layer settings:
- **Player**: For the player character
- **InteractableLayer**: For NPCs and interactive objects
- **SolidObjects**: For walls, obstacles, and collision objects

### Tags
Configure these tags in Unity's Tag Manager:
- **Player**: Player character identification
- **NPC**: Standard scripted NPCs
- **NPC_AI**: AI-powered NPCs with LLM integration
- **Player_Interaction_Point**: Player's interaction detection point
- **Interactable**: General interactable objects
- **GameController**: Main game controller object

6. Ensure proper input configuration in Unity Input settings

### üéÆ Game Controller Setup

#### Basic Configuration
- **Tag**: `GameController`
- **Layer**: `Default`

#### Required Scripts
1. **GameLayers** - *Layer management system*
   - Singleton providing global access to Unity layers
   - Configures layer masks for collision detection
   - Essential for physics system integration

2. **GameController** - *Main game state manager*
   - Manages game states (freeRoam vs dialogMode)
   - Coordinates between player and dialog systems
   - Handles state transitions and input routing

3. **AuthManager** - *IPC authentication system* **[CRITICAL REQUIREMENT]**
   - Manages secure communication between Unity and Python server
   - Generates dynamic secrets and authentication tokens
   - Provides IPC-based credential exchange via named pipes
   - **MUST be attached** - AI communication will fail without this component

4. **DialogManager** - *Conversation system controller*
   - Singleton managing all dialog interactions
   - Handles UI presentation and user input
   - Integrates with both scripted and AI conversations

5. **ServerSocketC** - *Network communication manager*
   - Singleton managing Python server communication
   - Handles TCP connections for AI NPCs with mandatory authentication
   - Manages server lifecycle and connection pooling
   - **Depends on AuthManager** for all AI communications

6. **Hasher** - *Connection management system*
   - Maps NPC GUIDs to network connections
   - Manages connection lifecycle and cleanup
   - Essential for multi-NPC AI communication

7. **Killports** - *Development utility*

   - Development-specific tooling

#### Game Controller Setup Process
1. Create new GameObject named "GameController"
2. Set tag to `GameController`
3. Set layer to `Default`
4. Add all required scripts (including **AuthManager - CRITICAL**)
5. **Verify AuthManager is attached** - Check component is present before proceeding
6. Configure references in GameController script (PlayerController, Camera)
7. Set up UI references in DialogManager (dialog box, text components)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Authentication Requirements
- **AuthManager MUST be attached to GameController** before any AI operations
- Game will fail to start Python server without proper AuthManager setup
- No fallback mode available - authentication is mandatory for all AI communications
- Initialization order: AuthManager ‚Üí ServerSocketC ‚Üí Python server startup
