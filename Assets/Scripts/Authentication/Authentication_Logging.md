## [2025-08-07 16:30] - GitHub Copilot - IPC Authentication System Implementation
**Component**: AuthManager.cs (NEW), ServerSocketC.cs, ServerSocketPython.py
**Observation**: Implemented mandatory IPC-based authentication system replacing file-based credential exchange with Windows named pipes for Unity-Python LLM communication
**Impact**: 
- Enhanced security with dynamic session-based authentication using system identifiers
- Eliminated file system dependencies by using in-memory named pipe communication
- Added mandatory GameController component requirement for AuthManager attachment
- Implemented token-based request validation for all AI communications
- Fixed authentication response concatenation issues with improved message handling
- Established secure credential exchange without disk writes or exploitable file surfaces
**Recommendations**: 
- Ensure AuthManager is always attached to GameController before testing AI features
- Monitor authentication handshake success rates and connection establishment times
- Consider implementing more granular token expiration policies for enhanced security
- Document Windows-specific dependencies (win32pipe) for deployment requirements
