# Scripts Logging File

This file is used by agentic models to log analysis, observations, and insights about the core game systems in the Scripts directory.

## Log Format
- **Timestamp**: Date and time of log entry
- **Component**: Specific script or system being analyzed
- **Observation**: What was observed or analyzed
- **Impact**: How this affects the overall system
- **Recommendations**: Suggested improvements or changes

## [2025-08-06 15:45] - GitHub Copilot - AI Dialog System Race Condition Fix
**Component**: DialogManager.cs (Core Dialog System)
**Observation**: Resolved race condition between HandleUpdate() and TypeDialog() methods that was causing empty user input to be sent to LLM backend
**Impact**: 
- Improved system reliability by preventing unnecessary backend API calls
- Enhanced user experience with proper dialog termination on empty input
- Reduced potential for memory leaks and infinite recursion scenarios
- Maintained consistency across AI dialog interaction patterns
**Recommendations**: 
- Continue monitoring dialog system performance and user interaction patterns
- Consider implementing input validation standards across all user input systems
- Review other potential race conditions in coroutine-based systems

## [2025-08-07 16:30] - GitHub Copilot - IPC Authentication System Implementation
**Component**: Authentication/AuthManager.cs (NEW), ServerFiles/ServerSocketC.cs, ServerFiles/ServerSocketPython.py
**Observation**: Implemented mandatory IPC-based authentication system for Unity-Python LLM communication
**Impact**: 
- **Security Enhancement**: All AI communications now secured with dynamic session-based authentication
- **Architecture Change**: AuthManager component MUST be attached to GameController for AI functionality
- **Eliminated File Dependencies**: Replaced file-based credential exchange with in-memory named pipes
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved authentication failure detection and response concatenation fixes
- **Mandatory Implementation**: No fallback mode - authentication required for all AI operations
**Recommendations**: 
- **Critical Setup**: Ensure AuthManager is attached to GameController before testing AI features
- **Documentation Review**: All setup guides updated to reflect authentication requirements
- **Testing Protocol**: Verify authentication handshake success before reporting AI communication issues
- **Future Enhancement**: Consider implementing token expiration policies for enhanced security
