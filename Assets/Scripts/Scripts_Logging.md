## [2025-08-06 15:45] - GitHub Copilot - AI Dialog System Race Condition Fix
**Component**: DialogManager.cs (Core Dialog System)
**Observation**: Resolved race condition between HandleUpdate() and TypeDialog() methods that was causing empty user input to be sent to LLM backend
**Impact**: 
- Improved system reliability by preventing unnecessary backend API calls
- Enhanced user experience with proper dialog termination on empty input
- Reduced potential for memory leaks and infinite recursion scenarios
- Maintained consistency across AI dialog interaction patterns
**Recommendations**: 
- Continue monitoring dialog system performance and user interaction patterns
- Consider implementing input validation standards across all user input systems
- Review other potential race conditions in coroutine-based systems
