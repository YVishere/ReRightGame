## [2025-08-06 15:45] - GitHub Copilot - Backend Empty Request Prevention
**Component**: DialogManager.cs (client-side validation affecting server communication)
**Observation**: Added client-side validation to prevent empty string requests from being sent to Python LLM server
**Impact**: 
- Reduces unnecessary network traffic to Python server
- Prevents LLM processing of empty conversation context
- Improves overall server performance and resource utilization
- Eliminates potential edge cases in server-side conversation parsing
**Recommendations**: 
- Monitor server logs for reduction in empty/invalid requests
- Consider implementing server-side validation as backup measure
- Review other client-side validation opportunities for network optimization
