## [2025-08-06 15:45] - GitHub Copilot - AI NPC Dialog Input Validation
**Component**: DialogManager.cs (affects AI NPC conversations)
**Observation**: Implemented input validation to prevent AI NPCs from processing empty user input and making unnecessary LLM backend calls
**Impact**: 
- AI NPCs now properly terminate conversations when user submits empty input
- Prevents wasteful LLM API calls that would process empty conversation context
- Improves AI NPC conversation flow and user experience
- Reduces backend server load from invalid requests
**Recommendations**: 
- Test with various AI NPCs to ensure consistent behavior
- Consider adding conversation context preservation for accidental empty submissions
- Monitor LLM server logs to verify reduction in empty request calls
