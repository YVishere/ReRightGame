## [2025-08-06 15:45] - GitHub Copilot - DialogManager Empty Input Fix
**Component**: DialogManager.cs - TypeDialog method
**Observation**: Fixed critical race condition where empty user input was being sent to LLM backend instead of ending the dialog properly
**Impact**: 
- Prevents empty strings from being sent to the backend LLM service
- Eliminates wasteful backend API calls with no content
- Fixes user experience issue where empty input didn't end conversations as expected
- Prevents potential infinite recursion and memory leaks from accumulating empty dialog entries
**Recommendations**: 
- Monitor for any edge cases with whitespace-only input
- Consider adding input validation for minimum character requirements
- Test dialog termination behavior across different NPCs

**Technical Details**:
- Added string.IsNullOrEmpty(userText.Trim()) check in TypeDialog method
- Implemented proper dialog cleanup on empty input detection
- Used yield break to prevent recursive ShowDialog calls with empty content
- Maintains consistency with HandleUpdate empty input behavior
